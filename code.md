# Code and Data

The ScEdit benchmark, dataset construction scripts, and evaluation code are publicly available to facilitate further research in script-based knowledge editing.

## GitHub Repository

You can access all resources at our GitHub repository:

**[ScEdit on GitHub: https://github.com/asdfo123/ScEdit](https://github.com/asdfo123/ScEdit)**

The repository includes:
* The ScEdit-CF and ScEdit-T datasets.
* Scripts for running Knowledge Editing methods.
* Evaluation scripts for token-level and text-level metrics.
* Instructions for setting up and using the benchmark.

We encourage the community to use ScEdit to evaluate new and existing knowledge editing techniques in these more challenging, script-oriented scenarios.
